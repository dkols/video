That 90-lap race is set to start at 1:30 p.m. EDT and you can watch it on the Fox Sports Network or live stream it on DirecTV Stream (FREE trial and discount) or Sling TV (discount). When it was over, Palou earned his first pole of the season and the seventh of his career with a top lap of 1 minute, 7.2918 seconds in the No. 10 HRC Chip Ganassi Racing Honda during the Firestone Fast Six.

Palou has won two of the first three races of this season, finishing second in the other, and has built a 34-point lead over Kyle Kirkwood of Andretti Global in the standings.

‚ÄúIt was super close. I don‚Äôt think my first lap [in the Firestone Fast Six] was very good,‚Äù Palous said. ‚ÄúI was just hoping to get a perfect lap on the second one on the alternates [Firestone Firehawk tires]. So, yeah, cannot wait for tomorrow now.‚Äù

Palou will seek his first win on the 17-turn, 2.3-mile natural-terrain road course since he earned his first series victory in his inaugural start with Chip Ganassi Racing in 2021. Palou drove for Dale Coyne Racing as a rookie in 2020.

The forecast looks great, with sunny skies and highs near 70 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

Two-time reigning Barber winner Scott McLaughlin will start second after his best lap of 1:07.4387 in the No. 3 Good Ranchers Team Penske Chevrolet. Colton Herta will start third after his best lap of 1:07.4576 in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda of Andretti Global.
